# Overview
The **Real News vs. Fake News Classification** project applies **machine learning (ML)** to detect misinformation in news articles. By leveraging **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and data visualization tools, we preprocess text data, build classification models, and optimize performance to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing real news from fake news.  

# Project Components**  

__1. Data Collection:__  
- The dataset consists of **news articles labeled as real or fake**.  
- Data is sourced from publicly available platforms like **Kaggle** and **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  
- Includes text-based features that require preprocessing before training ML models.  

__2. Data Preprocessing:__
Before applying machine learning models, data is cleaned and structured:  
- **Cleaning:** Remove missing values, duplicate entries, and irrelevant columns.  
- **Text Processing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, sentiment analysis, and word frequency.  
- **Normalization & Standardization:** Ensure consistent numerical scaling for optimal ML performance.  

__3. Model Building:__ 
The following machine learning models are implemented using **Scikit-learn**:  
- **Logistic Regression** – A baseline classifier for binary classification.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Constructs a hyperplane to separate real and fake news.  
- **Random Forest** – An ensemble model that enhances classification accuracy.  

__4. Model Optimization:__ 
To improve classification performance, we apply:  
- **GridSearchCV** – Systematic tuning of hyperparameters.  
- **RandomizedSearchCV** – Faster tuning through random search.  
- **Cross-Validation** – Ensuring the model generalizes well to new data.  

__Evaluation Metrics:__

Accuracy Score  
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score  
ROC Curve & AUC Score  

__5. Data Visualization:__

To communicate insights effectively, we use:  
- **Confusion Matrix** – Illustrates classification performance.
